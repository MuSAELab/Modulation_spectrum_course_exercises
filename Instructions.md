# Modulation spectrum course exercises:
This document will introduce dependencies needed to run the scripts as well as instructions for each exercise.<br />

This exercise is set up for people who are new to modulation spectrum to get some hands-on experience with using modulation spectrogram for speech (or other signals) analysis. After going through the exercise, participants should be able to use modulation spectrum for their own tasks. Two exercises are included: (1) """ex1""" shows how to extract modulation spectrogram from a single speech recording using the SRMR toolbox along with some visualizations; (2) """ex2""" shows how to use the extracted modulation spectrogram features for disease detection using machine learning.<br />
